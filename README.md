# Foxogyan Task 3 - Web page designing

This repo contains the code for the Clanits front page which was given to us as a task 3 for the mozillian of the year title at FoxoGyan

[Checkout this frontpage here](https://pavitra14.github.io/foxogyan-t3/)

To run this code locally, simply open the index.html

Or this code also works with reload so that you can work on the code as well as see it live, make sure you have reload installed globally or you can install it using

`npm install -g reload`

Once installed, in the base directory, run

`reload -b`

and a local server will be hosted at ::8080 with automatic live reloading, work on your code and don't bother about refreshing manually.

Frameworks used:

*   Bootstrap 4 (For CSS styling)
*   jQuery (For Fade-in and such effects and single page mechanism)
*   Popper.js (Bootstrap 4 requires popper.js to work, apparently it is required in drop down boxes and Nav-bars)
*   Font Awesome (For Cool mini icons)
